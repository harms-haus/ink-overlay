/**
 * Scene 10 — Animations (Stepped Style Transitions).
 *
 * Demonstrates every named transition preset, a custom `TransitionConfig`
 * built by cloning a preset, the `fade` = height-grow caveat, and the
 * exit-animation behavior.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Stepped Style Transitions
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Terminal UIs have no real alpha/transparency — there is no RGBA blending
 * at the cell level in a standard ANSI terminal. That means a genuine
 * "fade in / fade out" opacity ramp is physically impossible. Instead,
 * `ink-overlay` implements transitions as a SEQUENCE OF STYLE STEPS: each
 * frame swaps in a partial Box-style override (margins, height, etc.) so
 * the layer APPEARS to slide or collapse rather than dissolve.
 *
 * A `TransitionConfig` is `{enter?: TransitionStep[]; exit?: TransitionStep[];
 * duration?: number}` where `TransitionStep = {style: Record<string, number |
 * string>}`. The `enter` array is the list of frames played on mount/open;
 * `exit` is played on close/unmount. `duration` is the PER-FRAME delay in
 * milliseconds (NOT the total animation length).
 *
 * `getTransitionSteps(name)` returns one of six cached presets. The presets
 * are cached per name because their configs are deterministic — the same
 * name always yields the same frame sequence, so there is no need to
 * rebuild the object on every call. You can clone a preset and override
 * `duration` (or any other field) to tweak the speed — that is exactly what
 * the `c` key in this scene does (slide-up at 200ms/frame instead of 80).
 *
 * ── The six TransitionName presets ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 'none'      → single no-op frame on enter and exit. Effectively no
 *               animation at all. The layer mounts/unmounts instantly.
 *
 * 'fade'      → a HEIGHT GROW (0 → 1 rows), NOT opacity. Terminals have NO
 *               alpha/transparency channel, so a true dissolve is
 *               impossible. The name 'fade' is kept for API familiarity
 *               (it matches the vocabulary of web/CSS overlay libraries)
 *               but the visual effect is a collapse/expand: the layer
 *               starts at height 0 and snaps to height 1. Because the jump
 *               is from 0 to 1 in a single step, the effect is subtle —
 *               prefer the 'slide-*' presets for a clearly visible
 *               entrance.
 *
 * 'slide-up'   → marginTop steps 4 → 2 → 0. The layer slides up from
 *                below into its resting position.
 *
 * 'slide-down' → marginBottom steps 4 → 2 → 0. The layer slides down from
 *                above into its resting position.
 *
 * 'slide-left' → marginLeft steps 4 → 2 → 0. The layer slides in from the
 *                right toward the left.
 *
 * 'slide-right'→ marginRight steps 4 → 2 → 0. The layer slides in from the
 *                left toward the right.
 *
 * ── duration ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `duration` is the PER-FRAME delay in milliseconds, NOT the total
 * animation length. The slide presets each have 3 frames, so at the default
 * `duration` of 80ms the full enter animation is 3 × 80ms = 240ms total.
 * The custom config in this scene overrides `duration` to 200ms — slowing
 * it to 3 × 200ms = 600ms total — so you can clearly see each frame step.
 *
 * ── Exit animations ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An exit transition needs AT LEAST 2 exit frames to be visible. If the
 * `exit` array has ≤1 frame, the layer unmounts immediately with NO exit
 * animation at all — it simply disappears. The slide presets all have
 * 3 exit frames (the mirror of their enter frames), so toggling the layer
 * closed produces a visible slide-out. Press `o` to toggle open/closed and
 * watch the enter AND exit sequences play.
 *
 * ── Implementation note: setInterval, not ink's useAnimation ───────────
 *
 * Transitions are driven by a plain `setInterval` inside `useEnterExit`,
 * deliberately chosen over ink's built-in `useAnimation` hook. `useAnimation`
 * depends on the AnimationContext provider (only present inside ink's `<App>`)
 * and its shared timer/render-throttle semantics make deterministic
 * frame-counting hard to drive in tests. A self-contained interval is
 * trivially testable with real timers and `await delay()`.

				 * `transition` accepts a `TransitionName` string, a full

				 *
				 * - A string is resolved internally via
				 *   `getTransitionSteps(name)`, which returns the CACHED
				 *   preset `TransitionConfig` for that name. Because the
				 *   presets are cached/deterministic, you can call it as
				 *   often as you like with no allocation cost. Clone it
				 *   and override `duration` to tweak the speed — that is
				 *   what the `customConfig` above does (slide-up at
				 *   200ms/frame instead of the default 80).
				 *
				 * - A `TransitionConfig` object is used as-is. Its shape is
				 *   {enter?: TransitionStep[]; exit?: TransitionStep[];
				 *    duration?: number} where
				 *   TransitionStep = {style: Record<string, number | string>}.
				 *   You can fully author your own frame sequences this way.
				 *
				 * `open` / `onOpenChange` control the layer's visibility.
				 * Toggling `open` from true → false starts the EXIT
				 * animation (if the `exit` array has ≥2 frames), then
				 * unmounts. Toggling false → true re-runs the ENTER
				 * sequence. Press `o` to compare.
				 *
				 * EXIT ANIMATION REQUIREMENT: an exit transition needs
				 * ≥2 frames to be visible. If `exit` has ≤1 frame the
				 * layer unmounts immediately with no exit animation. All
				 * slide presets have 3 exit frames and 'fade' has 2 exit
				 * frames, so all of them play a visible exit animation;
				 * only 'none' is effectively instant on exit given its
				 * single exit frame.
				 *
				 * WHY setInterval (not ink's useAnimation): transitions are
				 * driven by a self-contained setInterval inside
				 * useEnterExit for deterministic, testable timing.
